The **Files** tab provides a full file manager for your server directory, with a built-in code editor for configuration files.

## Browsing Files

Navigate the server directory using the breadcrumb bar at the top. Folders are listed before files, sorted alphabetically.

## Editing Files

Click any text file to open it in **Monaco Editor** — the same editor that powers VS Code. Syntax highlighting is automatically applied based on the file extension:

| Extension       | Language mode           |
| --------------- | ----------------------- |
| `.json`         | JSON                    |
| `.yaml`, `.yml` | YAML                    |
| `.properties`   | Properties (key=value)  |
| `.toml`         | TOML                    |
| `.sh`, `.bat`   | Shell / Batch           |
| `.ts`, `.js`    | TypeScript / JavaScript |
| `.rs`           | Rust                    |

Press **`Ctrl/Cmd+S`** or click **"Save"** to write changes to disk.

## Creating Files and Folders

Click the **"+"** button in the toolbar:

- **New File** — enter a name; the file opens in the editor immediately
- **New Folder** — enter a folder name; it appears in the current directory

## Uploading Files

Drag files from your OS file manager into the Files view, or click the **upload** button to open a file picker. Files are placed in the currently browsed directory.

## Compressing and Extracting

Right-click a file or folder to access archive operations:

- **Compress** — creates a `.zip` archive next to the original item
- **Extract** — unpacks a `.zip` archive into the current directory

## Renaming, Moving, and Deleting

Right-click any file or folder for additional options:

- **Rename** — rename in place
- **Move** — move to another location within the server directory
- **Delete** — permanently remove the file or folder

:::caution
Deletions are permanent. There is no recycle bin. Create a [backup](/guide/features/backup-restore) before deleting important files.

## Opening in OS File Manager

Click **"Open in Finder"** (macOS) or **"Open in Explorer"** (Windows) to open the current directory in your operating system's native file manager.
